# CSS-icons
Welcome to my project repository where I explore the fundamentals of HTML and CSS. This project is dedicated to creating icons using pure CSS styling.

## About the Project
In this project, I focus on learning and experimenting with HTML and CSS by drawing icons solely with CSS. My first icon features my character, a cute girl from hell. This endeavor helps me enhance my skills and creativity with CSS.

Feel free to explore the code and see how I bring my designs to life with just HTML and CSS. Any feedback or suggestions are welcome!
